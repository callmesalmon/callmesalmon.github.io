So the US government. It... Exists, nothing more positive to say about it...
They released a paper like a year ago endorsing Rust (the programming language,
not the element) and spitting on C. This made me *mad*. I love C! It's definitely
my *favourite* language of all time. It's beautiful. But I'm not stupid... Sometimes...
But I realize the flaws of C: Memory leaks... Yeah, that's about it, but memory
leaks are a pretty serious issue and we need to work around it. Also, I like Rust,
don't get me wrong! It's just not my favourite language ever... At all. I enjoy
programming Rust, I just... Don't like the borrow checker...

*\*Gasp!\** I hear you say. But listen, it took me a while to even learn the borrow
checker, and I was pretty satisfied! But turns out I didn't learn the borrow checker.
I overlooked some things. Okay, throw tomatoes at me and call me stupid, just let me
talk! If a *normal* developer like me can't really learn the borrow checker in an hour,
there's probably a problem with it! Yeah, borrow checking is bad, sue me.

Typing, typing, typing. Rust's typing is *trash*. I remember once I needed to return
a string as a type. Me, an intellectual, decides to return an ``&str``. *"If a string
as a parameter is an ``&str``, I should return that, right? RIGHT!?"*. Think something
like this, but more complicated:

{% highlight rust %}
pub fn return_a_str() -> &str {
    return "Hello World!\n";
}
{% endhighlight %}

And that raises an error... Turns out (I looked it up after 40 minutes) that the
*return type* of a string is... ``String``? Wait, what? Why? Huh? What? Hmm? Huh?
To this day I still don't have any idea what that was...

Also, WATCH THIS:

{% highlight rust %}
fn main() {
    println!("Hello World!");
}
{% endhighlight %}

Does this compile? Does it? DOES IT? NO NO NO NO!!!!!! God, I think I'm going
insane... The function needs to be PUBLIC!!!! WHY!? WHY!?

Now, to answer the question of the ages: Is Rust... Good? The answer is... *Yes*,
the answer is yes. All of the above complaints are just small nitpicks in an
otherwise good language. It gets like a 7/10 on the good scale.

Anyway, I'm going to... Complain about Rust some more, and then digress when the
tomatoes are thrown... Install Rust plz.
