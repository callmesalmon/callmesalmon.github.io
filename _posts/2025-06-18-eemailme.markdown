Look, I promise this is an interesting story. So, in early january of this year, I fell into
a rabbit hole that I have not been able to crawl out of. It's about a mysterious github user
named @eemailme and how it led me to find out something that I did *not* know about until
now. And our tale starts with

## "test", the github repo
In my recomended on github, a new repo suddenly popped up... It was called
[test](https://github.com/eemailme/test) and was made by a mysterious user named
[eemailme](https://github.com/eemailme). This naturally peaked my curiosity and I decided
to go and look around a bit. There, I saw 2 issues, aptly named:

- ["Just doing stuff for fun! ps. I don't like AI" -Source: AI bot](https://github.com/eemailme/test/issues/8)
- [hey](https://github.com/eemailme/test/issues/5)

The first one is referring to the description of eemailme's github and then calling them an
AI bot. But that doesn't really matter for now. What I want to focus on is the second one
of these 2 issues, "hey".

## hey
"hey"'s description was 2 simple words: "shut" and "up", in that order. Whoever this
[donnaken](https://github.com/donnaken15) guy (the one who opened the issue) was, I knew
he *really* didn't like eemailme. But why?

This is a string of responses to this thread that explain the situation a bit:

1. [poka](https://github.com/poka-IT): What is this? Why 24 people stars this helloworld repo??
What is this issue???
So strange...
2. donnaken: this user adds a watch to every repo imaginable
[jchloos](https://github.com/jhcloos) v2
3. poka: ok, he watched my repo too, so I understand, this is how I came here ^^
jchloos v2?
The username is eemailme, so i email him... And probably go to sleep...
4. donnaken: jchloos is some random user with their own website who also botted watches on
(presumably) thousands of repos I thought it was someone actually flattering me but I figured out the ruse

*\[...\]*

5. [michael](https://github.com/mbostwick): Its a bot network..

And then the next message michael drops is:

6. michael: yah, it looks like its a manual user. I think there is some setup where the
person or persons behind the network is reading specific public code and building A.I tools
using the code. There is a real person though who reads the emails. I thought this was
connected to a larger criminal network of attorneys I've been dealing with, but the behaviors 
suggest its more of a fringe company. Everything is white labeled right now, they also appear
to be using cut outs to avoid facing legal action. They are not following git hubs terms of 
service though. I'd say more but I don't want to expose too much yet..

## michael
The fuck you mean Michael!? Not exposing too much yet!? WDYM!? As you'll see, our pal Mike here
is very important to the story. A few messages pass and then one of our most important characters
drops in like a bombshell: [hexcode](https://github.com/0XDE57) (Who I'll call "hex")

7. hex: this smells (potentially) related?: <https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/stargazers-ghost-network>

Hex links to this very important blog post by "checkpoint", talking about a ghost-network of stargazers
(people who star repos). Please go read it for yourself before you continue on. After this bombshell
hits, the thread is quiet for a while, with some ["edouard"](https://github.com/edouard-sn) guy getting
a false positive with his antivirus along the way. But this is where I come in.
[I](https://github.com/callmesalmon), at the time, believing all of this was due to corruption,
posted a message:

8. me: How is it possible that these users aren't banned by github? Is github that corrupt nowadays???

And this is where Michael starts playing a bigger role.

## The internet: A weird place

9. michael: I'm not sure why you would assume its corruption ? There is a real person behind it. Do you have
anything to show they are doing anything but watching you and pulling the code thats been put out in the open ?

10. me: Yeah, tbh kinda impulsive of me to say -_-, it's just kind of... Weird?

11. michael: I understand and I did a bit of research,
[mbostwick/agile-game#5](https://github.com/mbostwick/agile-game/issues/5) ,
the internet is a weird place ..

Now, I'm too lazy to document his "bit of research", so if you have the time, read it yourself.
If not, you're on your own. I respond:

12. me: That is certainly interesting. I did not expect this to turn out as it did. I'll have to
agree with you; The internet is a weird place.

## The internet: 6 months later
And now... We get to the fun bit. The one where I do the research myself. On the same project, I
see 2 *closed* issues. A very important one, hides here.

## [+](https://github.com/eemailme/test/issues/4)
I'll let you draw your own conclusions here ;)
