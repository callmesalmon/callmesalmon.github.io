Boilerplate. The worst programming *thing* ever. I once asked my friend
if he'd rather meet the devil or write boilerplate code, and they answered
that they'd rather write boilerplate code!? Psycho!!! And one language, known
as the pioneer of boilerplate code, is certainly NOT Go. Yet Go has a fundemental
problem in its error handling that causes a *lot* of boilerplate code.

## I: Assessing the problem

Take a look at this python code:

{% highlight python %}
try:
    print("Hello World!");
except Exception:
    print("NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO");
{% endhighlight %}

*Yes*, I will say something positive about python for once, this is
*good code*. It's not boilerplate code and it's awesome! Now, take
this Go code:

{% highlight go %}
_, err := fmt.Println("Hello World!");
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println("NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO");
}
{% endhighlight %}

This code is... Fine, but it causes a lot of boilerplate. Essentially,
every time you want to error handle, you have to do this:

{% highlight go %}
_, err := function();
if err != nil {
    do_something_about_it();
}
{% endhighlight %}

THIS IS TERRIBLE!!! It's the only thing that programmers should be
fundamentally against: *boilerplate*. So lets take a look at some
solutions!

## II: try/catch

Perhaps the most common solution to this is the ``try/catch`` error
handling method. Basically:

{% highlight python %}
try:
   # Try to do something, perhaps:
   #     print("Hello World!");
# The conventional approach is:
#     except ERROR:
# but in some languages this is
# allowed.
except:
    # Do something if the ``try`
    # Statement fails, perhaps:
    #     print("ERROR: Something went wrong!");
{% endhighlight %}

This has been highlighted as a solution in [this paper](https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/32437-try-builtin.md), and this is the paper summarized (for you lazy people out there):

## III: The try/catch paper

We propose a new built-in function called try, designed specifically to eliminate the boilerplate
if statements typically associated with error handling in Go. No other language changes are suggested.
The try built-in is easy to explain, straightforward to implement, orthogonal to other language constructs,
and fully backward-compatible. It also leaves open a path to extending the mechanism, should we wish to do
so in the future. We propose to add a new function-like built-in called try with signature (pseudo-code):

{% highlight go %}
func try(expr) (T1, T2, … Tn)
{% endhighlight %}

where ``expr`` stands for an incoming argument expression (usually a function call) producing n+1 result
values of types ``T1``, ``T2``, ... Tn, and error for the last value. If expr evaluates to a single value
(n is 0), that value must be of type error and try doesn't return a result. Calling try with an expression
that does not produce a last value of type error leads to a compile-time error. The try built-in may only be
used inside a function with at least one result parameter where the last result is of type error. Calling try
in a different context leads to a compile-time error. Invoking try with a function call f() as in
(pseudo-code):

{% highlight go %}
x1, x2, … xn = try(f())
{% endhighlight %}

turns into the following (in-lined) code:

{% highlight go %}
t1, … tn, te := f()  // t1, … tn, te are local (invisible) temporaries
if te != nil {
        err = te     // assign te to the error result parameter
        return       // return from enclosing function
}
x1, … xn = t1, … tn  // assignment only if there was no error
{% endhighlight %}

## IV: Is try/catch good?

... Not really. I like the idea, I like it a lot, don't get me wrong! It's
just a bit... Problematic. Firstly, it's a function and not a keyword. For
this implementation to even be considered, I'd like it to look more like:

{% highlight go %}
try {
    function_1();
} except {
    function_2();
}
{% endhighlight %}

Or maybe with different error values, like this:

{% highlight go %}
try {
    function_1();
} except StackOverflowError {
    function_2();
}
{% endhighlight %}

But then again, try/catch isn't really a *good* error handling method,
it's ugly and still requires *some* boilerplate. I draw the conclusion
that try/catch *isn't* good. But bonus points for effort!

## V: The fabled "?"

Not too long ago, a [discussion](https://github.com/golang/go/discussions/71460) was opened on the go github repo, proposing
a *new* error handling strategy. It's basically rust's "?"
operator all over again. It's basically:

{% highlight go %}
function_1()?
{% endhighlight %}

EWW... It's like I'm asking a question! *Does anybody want some function_1()?* EWW!!!
Okay, let's give it a shot...

## VI: The "?" paper summarized

This section presents the formal proposal.

An assignment or expression statement may be followed by a question mark (?). The question mark is a new syntactic element, the first permitted use of ? in Go outside of string and character constants. The ? causes conditional execution similar to an if statement. A ? at the end of a line causes a semicolon to be automatically inserted after it.

A ? uses a value as described below, referred to here as the qvalue.

For a ? after an assignment statement, the qvalue is the last of the values produced by the right hand side 
of the assignment. The number of variables on the left hand side of the assignment must be one less than the
number of values produced by the right hand side (the right hand side values may come from a function call
as usual). It is not valid to use a ? if there is only one value on the right hand side of the assignment.

For a ? after an expression statement the qvalue is the last of the values of the expression. It is not
valid to use a ? after an expression statement that has no values.

The qvalue must be of interface type and must implement the predeclared type error; that is, it must have
the method Error() string. In most cases it will simply be of type error.

A ? is optionally followed by a block. The block may be omitted if the statement using ? appears in the body
of a function, and the enclosing function has at least one result, and the qvalue is assignable to the last
result (this means that the type of the last result must implement the predeclared type error, and will
often simply be error).

Execution of the ? depends on the qvalue. If the qvalue is nil, execution proceeds as normal, skipping over
the block if there is one.

If the ? is not followed by a block, and the qvalue is not nil, then the function returns immediately. The
qvalue is assigned to the final result. If the other results (if any) are named, they retain their current
values. If they are not named, they are set to the zero value of their type. The results are then returned.
Deferred functions are executed as usual.

If the ? is followed by a block, and the qvalue is not nil, then the block is executed. Within the block a
new variable err is implicitly declared, possibly shadowing other variables named err. The value and type of
this err variable will be those of the qvalue.

That completes the proposal.

## VII: Is "?" good?

Uhh, no!? It's ugly and... Very strange? Like

{% highlight go %}
some_function() ? {
    fmt.Println("NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO");
}
{% endhighlight %}

is not something i want to write right now and it's kind of
hard to read? It's very implicit and... UGLY AND TERRIBLE AND
TRASH AND AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!

## VIII: How do we fix this?

Now... How do we fix this? How do we solve this problem
*once and for all?* Do we

* a) Use the ``try/catch`` method?
* b) Use the ``?`` method?
* c) Venture into the depths of the internet in search
of a better way?

Well... The true option worth considering is

## IX: d) Is it really worth it?

Think about it? Is it worth it? I'm here writing a blog post
about me trying *desperately* to find a solution to this -- In reality --
trivial problem, is that worth it? I'm stuck travelling in the depths
of my mind, desperately in search of answers, a solution, hell, even just
confirmation that it's impossible! Every second, every moment, I'm stuck in
my own personal hell... Thinking, yet not doing. But alas, I had hope, I had
fervour. I wanted to find the truth to this problem -- I wanted to make my
favourite language perfect, to make *my projects* perfect! A solution that
would help me get out of this boilerplate hell... Get out of this *place*.
GET OUT OF THIS LANGUAGE!!! Will there ever be a better way, will there
ever be a better life, will there ever be peace? WILL THERE EVER BE ANYTHING,
IN THIS GOLANG HELL!? TELL ME!!! Will this language ever be perfect? When I
set out on this adventure I thought that I could absolve myself of this
burden of mine, this burden of the language, this burden of the world!!!
Stuck in a loop of solution upon solution, yet never finding anything!!!
EVERY SINGLE SOLUTION HAS A FLAW!!! UGLY, TERRIBLE, HARD TO READ, YOU NAME
IT!!! THE WORLD WILL NEVER BE FREE OF GO'S ERROR HANDLING, *I* WILL NEVER
BE FREE!!! Every project I've EVER made in Go has this terrible error handling;
[octal](https://github.com/ElisStaaf/octal), [soup](https://github.com/ElisStaaf/soup),
AND MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MORE!!! A SOLUTION FREE OF BURDEN A SOLUTION FREE OF SIN!!!

But I will never find it... And I know that now...

*Or do I?*

## X: The solution

What I can conclude from this wild whirlwind of ideas
is that you can't fix the system from within... I was actually
thinking of drawing an allegory to capitalism *right here*, but
this is a programming blog, not a political theory blog. My proposal
is that the go errors need to be reworked. The ``error`` type needs
to be fixed, and then we can fix the system! I don't know where
we'll go from there, but this is a good, -- no -- great starting
point! And if we can accomplish this, then we're halfway to greatness.

## XI: Goodbyes

Thank you for coming with me on this adventure, were I considered ideas
and criticized them both, then found my own idea... I'll be seeing you
later! I hope.
