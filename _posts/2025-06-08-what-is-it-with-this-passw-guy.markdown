So there's this project I made called pearlOS. Great project, you should really check
it out, but that's not the point of the story. One day a few months ago I wake up to see
that someone forked pearlOS. Strange, 'cause it only has 6 stars and is relatively unpopular.
Who made this fork? @Passw, of course! This guy is an interesting character for sure.
When I click on his profile I see that his activity is private for some reason. When I
see his repos I immediately understand why.

## 2.7k repos and all of them are forked
To understand why he has 2.7k repos and why all of them are forked, I immediately began scrolling
trough all of his repos. There are thousands of repos, all named like this:
(NAME_OF_CREATOR)-(REPO_NAME). Huh, that's strange. Then I see that one of my other repos have been
cloned by this passw guy: Kite. An even more obscure choice since I'm the only one that even knows
of it. This is strange so I commence in googling
