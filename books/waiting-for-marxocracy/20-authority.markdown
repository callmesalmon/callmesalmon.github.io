# Authority
In ["Liberty"](/books/waiting-for-marxocracy/liberty), I explained how libertarianism is bad (especially
on the consumption side), but there's also another extreme: *Totalitarianism*.
Because -- surprise -- totalitarianism is bad!

## Totalitarianism
can be explained with the following satirical piece:

[![1984 was a guide.](/images/ingsoc.jpg)](/)

Because yes. It's not the government I'm talking about, it's the corporations.
Corporations (like Redhat!) act in their own self-interest and restrict both
consumption and governing. They act with stone cold precision and govern as such.

## Big corporation™ governing system
Dictatorship. It's dictatorship. It's feudalism. With the lords being the HRs and
the boss™, exploiting the peasantry™ being, well the lower ranking workers.

## The boss™
The boss™ is a dictator. It's simple as that. In FOSS, especially. He (because sadly,
basically the only people in power in these governments are men) sits on his high chair,
looking over the peasantry with his wife™ saying "Let them eat cake!"™.

## Consumption policies™
The consumption policies of big corporation™ tends to be overly authoritarian and "short
term", think:

*"Your free trial for 'project_x™' has run out, buy project_x™'s subscription
for only €99,99!"*

And:

*"You are not allowed to use project_x™ as you broke one of the restrictions written
in the license, you are being sued for €999,999,99."*

So, let me define a new term: *Conauthoritarianism™* (or, it's not *really* new, but
basically new).

*Conauthoritarianism is a consumption ideology that places many restrictions on
consumption. Often confused with conrestrictionism, with some restrictions
on software.*

"This is bad!"™, and that shouldn't come as a shock to you, if you're not a
fascist (AKA big R Republican). The sad thing is that this is basically the consumption
policy of 100%™ of all IT-based corporations.

## The project_x™s of the world
I have been talking about this caricature; *project_x™* for the whole chapter, but why?
Well, there are way to many project_x™s of the world, so it's hard to pick one to
criticize. That's why project_x™ is the name is chose. I was planning to list
project_x™s now, but there are just too many. *Way* too many. For further reading,
see ["Corporate Dominance in Open Source Ecosystems:
A Case Study of OpenStack"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3540250.3549117).
In the study, they examine FOSS and corporate dominance, and come
to this conclusion:

*As corporate participation in OSS ecosystems is growing, their in-
fluence on the future evolution of these ecosystems also becomes
stronger, which in turn can have significant consequences for the
sustainability of these ecosystems. In this paper, we present a de-
tailed study of one popular OSS ecosystem, OpenStack, to (a) es-
tablish corporate dominance as a prevalent issue, (b) identify five
patterns of corporate dominance, and (c) apply survival analysis
on a large set of repositories, and find that corporate dominance of
repositories negatively associates with their survival chance.
This paper is among the first to provide a detailed investigation of
corporate dominance in OSS ecosystems, which we hope will draw
more attention to this phenomenon which may have a significant
impact on the future of OSS ecosystems. The findings of this study
may help OSS communities to increase their awareness of this issue
and the associated risks, and adjust their governance mechanisms
so as to ensure their future sustainability.*
