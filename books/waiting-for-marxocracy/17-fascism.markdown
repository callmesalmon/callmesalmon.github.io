# Fascism
*"The receptivity of the masses is very limited, their intelligence is small, but their
power of forgetting is enormous. In consequence of these facts, all effective propaganda
must be limited to a very few points and must harp on these in slogans until the last
member of the public understands what you want him to understand by your slogan."*  
\- Literally Hitler

I know this might come as a shock to some people, but *I don't really like fascism
that much*, which makes it only sadder what this chapter is about. Time to tie up
another lose end: *Fascism, Republicans and conservatism*. I've been mentioning
all of these *a lot* in the book so far, so let's talk about it.

## Prominence
*"You know the USA? I don't live there, but I certainly know it. There's a certain
politician there who has followers so tribal, so forgiving to their holy leader:
That they'll forgive him for committing multiple felonies. His name is Donald J.
Trump and he is now -- somehow -- the president of the USA. What I'm trying to
convey is that the FOSS community is almost as tribal as the USA Republican party
(though it be for a more noble cause), and that leads to... Situations. Certainly."*

*"We’ve already covered how there’s already a pretty big part of the FOSS community
that are schizophrenic and don’t have a single good opinion. These people are called
'Republicans' and are truly the worst of the worst of FOSS. /.../ The people that say
'The US is a meritocracy' though, I believe: Are nationalists in disguise so there’s
no need to consider them."*

*"So, they left and created an 'apolitical' (by which I mean: 'conservative
nationalist') fork of the Godot engine known as 'Redot' (an awful name for an
awful engine made by awful people). By the way, Redot is several commits behind
Godot, so it’s inferior to its 'woke' counterpart."*

*"You know… I’m starting to notice a correlation between FOSS and the USA Republican
party… Strangely tribal, strangely elitist and strangely discriminatory!"*

*"Republicans and FOSS-users have yet another thing in common: Cultism. USA’s president
Donald J. Trump, – the racist businessman – has built a kind of 'cult of personality'
around himself. And then we have pedophile-sympathizer Richard Stallman, who has
done the same thing."*

*"In this book so far, you might have noticed an… Intersection between the alt-right
(Republicans) and the FOSS-community. They act the same! THE SAME! Haven’t you noticed
yet? There’s a lot of similarities between our pal DJ. T and Richard Stallman."*

*"IT’S IMPLIED THAT YOU SHOULDN’T BE RACIST, SEXIST AND HOMOPHOBIC, JUST LIKE IT IS IN
REAL LIFE! Only conservatives and fascists believe that it’s acceptable to be any of
these things, and I don’t want conservatives and fascists contributing to my project.
The only acceptable type of discrimination is political discrimination in the pursuit
of egalitarianism. Fascists are not welcome in my project!"*

*"the fascists politics boils down to 'Egalitarianism is so super duper bad!' (just a
reminder, the Republicans are fascists, or at least rightist-populist). 'We shouldn’t
own things collectively', the greedy capitalist pigs say. 'WE ARE BETTER THAN THE POOR
PERSON.'"*

*"Also, come to think of it, isn’t Trump like… Scarily similar to 'mein führer' AKA
Adolf Hitler? They talk a lot about vermin and they’re both fascist."*  
\- Me (Elis Staaf), Waiting for marxocracy (2025)

Above is *every single* mention of conservatives, Republicans and fascists in this
book. *"But why, Elis? Why does this matter?"* Well, I needed to highlight how many
times I needed to talk about fascists to properly highlight their prominence in
FOSS. These fascists are *everywhere*. It's almost like... A *lot* of people in
the FOSS community are fascists! WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!? But yeah... It's
true. They are scarily prominent.

*Pictured: What a lot of FOSS-users want to be: A failed socialist turned dictator
who everybody wants dead, but just can't quite reach because he's in hiding.*

## Examples
Fascism comes in many forms, but in FOSS terms: *It's never apparent*. They're not
STUPID! Yet I believe I may posess a small but comprehensive list of the most popular
fascist projects. They are: (with *"..."* meaning *"And more!"*)

  - Tar
  - R
  - Nano

- Corporation projects
  - Google

## Are you a fascist?
Are you a... Ahem, I'll just pull up the wiki. Are you a supporter of:

*A system of government marked by centralization of authority under a
dictator, a capitalist economy subject to stringent governmental controls,
violent suppression of the opposition, and typically a policy of belligerent
nationalism and racism. A system of government marked by centralization of
authority under a dictator, a capitalist economy subject to stringent
governmental controls, violent suppression of the opposition, and typically
a policy of belligerent nationalism and racism.*

If so, get out. Get the fuck out. I do not want fascists reading my book.
You're a dirty ultra-nationalist who doesn't deserve anything, not even
the pseudo-enjoyment of reading this book.

## Antifa
Combatting against fascism is an essential part of not only marxocracy, but basic
decency. This can be done in many different ways, for example not giving them a
platform or publicly persecuting them in the name of egalitarianism. Another
*very good* way is by using the [Antifa MIT license](https://https://github.com/jamiebuilds/anti-fascist-mit-license)
to keep dirty fascists away from your source code. Speak openly against fascism,
saying things like *"I don't want fascism in MY FOSS!"*, or something like that,
I'm not a rhetorical expert.
