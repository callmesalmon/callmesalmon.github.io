# The status quo
So far, we've established what practices to follow and *not* to follow, but there
is a question we haven't covered yet: *What is the status quo?* For example, in
modern society, Neoliberalism is the status quo, but there isn't an established
status quo that I've covered in my book yet!

## Principles
The core principles of the status quo is -- as explained in ["Foss
culture"](/books/waiting-for-marxocracy/foss-culture) -- largely libertarian,
both on the consumption side and governing side.

### Consumption
On the consumption side, I'd describe the status quo as *conlibertist*, as it largely
believes in almost unlimited consumption (as we can see with most OSS-licenses, like
GPL or MIT). I have already gone into detail on why it's bad, so I'll just quote myself
(["Liberty"](/books/waiting-for-marxocracy/liberty)):

*... You know, I was planning to put a satirical piece right here, but the problem
with libertarianism -- unlike Godotism -- is that it's not very funny, it's just
plain bad. I guess I'll use this section to highlight the core problems with
Conlibertism, I guess. These are:*

1. *In their eyes, "Any customization is good customization."*
2. *It leads to a worse project overall.*
3. *They prefer extensibility over quality.*

*It's quite honestly a sad reflection upon our society that these kinds of
philosophies have thrived, since they're largely reactionary. They poke up in
response to authoritarianism in FOSS, and I honestly can't blame them.*

### Governance
On the governing side... It's mixed. A lot of projects don't clearly follow any
of the governance-systems mentioned in chapters [3](/books/waiting-for-marxocracy/communism) -
[7](/books/waiting-for-marxocracy/bdfl). You know what time it is:
*Unintuitive-solution-with-no-real-meaning-that-can-be-accomplished-in-a-simpler-way-time*!
So let's use a graph! We'll have the x scale representing how egalitarian it is (left: most,
right: least) and the y scale representing how authoritarian it is (up: most, down: least).
With that said, let's plot some systems onto this graph:

Working from here, we can calculate that the status quo would be libertarian (as we've
already covered *that*), and as such, in the "-y" section. From here, we know that FOSS
is very unequal but not dystopia-unequal, with this, we can calculate that it is in the
+x-y section, but where? Well, it's very libertarian, but not *dystopia* unequal, so
maybe on the y level of actocracy, with *almost* the x level of oligarchy? Yes, that
would be it! Working from this, we can calculate that the position for the status quo
is

[![*New* governing system compass](/images/new-gov-comp.png)](/)

Using this visual representation, we can accurately calculate that the status quo of
FOSS is... A largely unequal and libertarian governing system!

## But... Why?
Why is the status quo like this? Why is it so largely unequal? Well, that's probably because
-- and it's probably time to realize this -- no one cares. I'm like, the only person that cares!
They're not the ones writing books about FOSS-governance systems, that's me! People throw
together governing systems on a whim, not like us: Carefully considering every possibility.
For them, the... Coding is the most important part. And while I praise them for actually
coding -- unlike me, just writing a weird book -- this leads to inequality in masses. But
I think it's time to come to the sad realization that *nobody cares*.

NOBODY EVER CARES.  
NOBODY EVER DID.  
NOBODY EVER WILL.  
NOBODY EVER SHOULD.  
NOBODY EVER.

Or is it that
- bribery,
- donations,
- corruption,
- comically evil people,
- dictators,
- fascists,
- nazis
- wannabe dictators
- elitists,
- oligarchs,
- capitalism and
- plutocracy

is ruining FOSS? Is it that FOSS *is* getting ruined, and my writing *wasn't* for
nothing? Wow! This book just started because I was just really passionate about
both FOSS and politics, but maybe there actually *are* problems with FOSS, not just
illusions I made up while trying to entertain myself on a Sunday afternoon? Are there
actual problems with FOSS? Are there problems with the governance of FOSS projects?
Do FOSS cults actually exist? Are fascists actually prevalent in FOSS? I actually wrote
about something original, for once! And not just something original, something important!
And not just something important, something *special*.

So, without further ado, let's get onto the sumarization/ending of this book. It's good,
I hope... It compiles all of my ideas into a short manifesto, at least!
