# Remaining human
It's easy to forget that FOSS-developers (which includes *me*) are humans too. The
sad thing with doing this FOSS-politics thing I'm talking about is that... It's
easy to lose yourself. When trying to push for democracy, you might find yourself
a "political martyr" or just a coder and not human. *"How do I, a coder, remain
human?"*

## What is humanity?
Humanity is basically having a soul, a personality! It's the thing we *don't* want
to lose. A soul is -- if you're an atheist like me -- just hormonal reactions in
the body, but in this chapter we're talking about the philosophical definition:
Basically just an arbitrary thing that exists and makes you feel things.

## Preserving humanity
You are not a robot. You are human, and you should do your best to stay that way.
But how? Mental health advice time! "In a manifesto?", I hear you ask. Yes! To
follow my ideas it's important to have a life to follow them in.

### Have a life
Do other things. Don't just sit and program. Do other stuff, like... Read a book
or maybe go out and have a walk! Enjoy life, and then you can enjoy the benefits
of my ideas!

### Also... Program other stuff
You're a programmer! Program! The politics can wait for later, especially if you...
Don't have a project? Don't be a politics machine, be a programming one!

### Recreational activities
Meditate and eat healthy food, be healthy, have a life! *Especially* read, it's a
very calming activity that helps you with mental health.

## Consequences of not
*"Why? Why should I care?"*, I can predict you asked. Well, depression is a *real*
thing. Not having a life and participating in recreational activities can quickly
spiral into depression which... Isn't good? *"I have spiraling depression!"* is
not something you want to say. Live a life and live it to the fullest.

## Corporatization
For the love of god, do *not* corporatize your project and *especially* don't
corporatize yourself! I brought this up in ["Code of conduct"](/books/waiting-for-marxocracy/code-of-conduct),
but do *not* corporatize your project! I brought up a commit I made on one of my
projects which I believe said

*A few weeks ago I saw some community standards on how to make a \[Github]
repo. I, eagerly waiting for something to do, added these in with
delight. Now, looking back, I realize that the community standards were
utter and complete bullshit and that you should never follow them. I
think it also gave of a corporatized "squeaky clean" look. For example
with the "CODE OF CONDUCT". Like, what the fuck? I am a firm believer
that software should not be corporatized, and this just felt wrong.
Also, if you need a document to tell you what you can and can't do; I
don't want your \[contribution]. Isn't it like implied that you shouldn't
be racist, sexist and homophobic? Who thinks "Hmm... I wonder if I can
say something bad about gay people here. Let's check the code of conduct!
Then I'll know if I can be an anti-gay womanizer \[nazi]!"!? If anyone
reading this needs an arbitrary paper to tell you what to do; get out.*

If we ruthlessly corporatize FOSS, we're almost as bad as the dirty capitalists
that try the same thing (though they want to *steal* our projects)! Some good
examples of corporatized FOSS-projects are

- Godot
- Ubuntu
- VSCode
- Chromium
- Redhat fuckery
  - Fedora
  - RHEL
  - OpenSUSE

You should *try* to avoid these projects, with one exception: Godot. Unity and
Unreal-engine are much worse alternatives and even if Godot is greedy, the others
are *more* greedy.

## The Redhat massacre
Redhat is a greedy and disgusting company trying to exploit FOSS to generate money.
On their website, [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/17/1/cultivating-business-foss-market)
they refer to FOSS as an "emerging market". They refer to FOSS as just another venture
to them, just like I said in ["Venture capitalism"](/books/waiting-for-marxocracy/capitalism).
They slowly massacre small FOSS projects in order to take their place. Boycott Redhat
for a better future. Also, Redhat says *we* must treat *them* with respect:

*Most importantly, the FOSS community must try to be patient, non-judgmental, and
empathetic when businesses inevitably stumble.*

WHAT!? WE!? We need to be "empathetic" and "patient" when the businesses *we* hate
fail! Here's another excerpt that just confirms my point:

*While those of us on the management and business side of things learn how we enter
the emerging market of FOSS, there's no reason FOSS communities, projects, and
supporters can't do a little to help out our end. /.../  The FOSS community can
do its part to help a business do this, perhaps even by reaching out and offering
to teach them.*

So please. Remain human. Don't be greedy. I'd like to end this chapter with the
*most* greedy excerpt of the post:

*Assisting businesses to enter the FOSS emerging market and picking them up should
they fall will go a long way toward dispelling these misconceptions and **we will
all reap the benefits** of broadening the scope of our collaborations.*
