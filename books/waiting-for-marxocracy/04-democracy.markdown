# Democracy
Are most FOSS-projects democracies? Uhh... No? Most FOSS-projects
are either dictatorships or following Fossarchy-Mossarchy (the
collective ideology of Fossarchy and Mossarchy). More civilized,
structured and bigger projects might have another way of doing it
but that's in no way guaranteed.

## VIM
VIM (Vi IMproved) is a text editor made by (RIP) Bram Moolenaar.
VIM is what I'd like to call a charitocracy, which in FOSS terms
means the following:

*A charitocracy is a FOSS-governance method that can easily be
summarized in one sentence: Democracy for the charitable. For example:
VIM is charityware and people that donate to the VIM foundation (which
in turn donates to a foundation to help starving children in Uganda)
are the charitocrats. They can engage in direct democracy (which is
also one of the principles of technomarxism).*

Though, for the most part: Bram Moolenaar was a BDFL, so before he
sadly passed away, it was more like a charito-dictatorship (the collective
term for a charitocracy and a dictatorship that coexist). Nowadays:
It's basically a charitocracy.

## Why VIM?
I bring up VIM in a response to the notion that "democracy is impossible in
FOSS", which many people (sadly) seem to be under the impression of. VIM is
a very close example of a FOSS-democracy. People of the world, open source
is supposed to be democratic!

## FOSS-Democracy and Counter-Authoritarianism
FOSS sprung up in response to a increasingly authoritarian market, where
monopolies control everything and the small projects of the world slowly
wither away, never to be seen again. FOSS was able to counteract this
trough helping each other and providing the common man with counter-authoritarian
tools as well as counter-authoritarian software. After hearing this, doesn't
FOSS-Democracy sound like the next step? We can't both be counter-authoritarian
*and* authoritarian, right? Yet Fossarchy-Mossarchy is way to deregulated for a
software development community to ever thrive in. Democracy is the comfortable
life we live in, why not bring it to our software, too?

## Modern FOSS
In modern FOSS, democracies are very rare, even among bigger projects! Godot,
for example: It's by no means a democracy. Democracy is also what I believe to
be the first step toward Marxocracy in the modern FOSS-sphere. Nowadays,
worse systems like meritocracy or maybe even oligarchy dominate the FOSS
market. It is truly a disgusting sight.

## Curbing democracy
Democracy in FOSS -- just like democracy in real life -- is not unbreakable.
A good way to illustrate this is to define an inevitable roadmap for any
FOSS project. I will call this roadmap "The FOSS-corruption cycle":

1. A FOSS project is formed.
2. It gets larger.
3. It assumes democracy.
4. It gets even larger.
5. It opens up a donation option.
6. Large corporation donates ~€10,000,000.
7. Corporation controls everything.
8. A possible fork is formed, the fork recurses.

What often happens in FOSS is that bigger companies go and invest in smaller
-- yet popular -- projects (for example: Godot is closer to an oligarchy than
a democracy). It's a very sad process that ruins FOSS-projects worldwide and
impacts all of the developers of the impacted project.

## Breaking the cycle
How are we supposed to break the cycle? Break the cycle of corruption in
open source so prevalent in the modern day? I'll give you a second to
think...  3, 2, 1... Okay, please look at step 5. "It opens up a donation
option". What we can do is... Just not. If we don't accept money from
these big corporations, we can't get curbed out of our democracy! Do
not fold! Stay strong and never give up on maintaining both your project,
and democracy.

## Anti-partisanship
A modern democracy tends to be a *representative democracy*. While this *may*
sometimes work in real-life, it never works in FOSS. You see, a party is
less an organization than a package of beliefs, which more often than
not leads to tribalism (if you want to know why that's a problem,
refer to [FOSS-culture](/books/waiting-for-marxocracy/foss-culture)).
In Marxocracy and FOSS-democracy in general, it's important to be
anti-partisan, meaning not being for any party, and not wanting any
parties. There's very much a reason for me citing *direct democracy*
as a core part of Marxocracy, and not just *democracy*.

## Initiating conversation
If you agree with my ideas and want to spread them: A good way
to do so is to propose democracy to an open-source project you
contribute frequently to. It may be a big project, it may be a
small one. The important thing is to initiate democracy. Every
new democratic project is one step towards full Marxocracy.
For further reading on FOSS-democracy -- which also coincidentally
brings up many of the points about anarchy I've covered --, see
[this paper](https://prezi.com/koxlpmckjpv6/foss-as-a-model-for-participative-democracy/),
which more or less confirms democracy as the right way of
governance for FOSS. Unlike what we'll be covering next:
