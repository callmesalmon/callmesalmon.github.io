# FOSS-culture
FOSS culture is largely built on *libertarian* ideas. That is understandable,
since FOSS stands for "*Free* and Open Source Software" and is completely
based upon the idea of "Everybody can use, modify and distribute it".
Me, personally: I am not the *most* libertarian person out there but...
Yeah, I believe software *needs* to be free and open source. The only
problem this raises is *libertarian governance*. And by "libertarian
governance", I mean *anarchy* and *minarchy*. Basically it means
*"Do what you want"*/*"Do almost what you want"*. While this is
very good in the *distribution* of open-source: This book is about
the *development* of open-source. And in that case, *anarchy* is...
BAD! Shocking, right? But if you don't understand what I mean,
I'd like to explain that to you.

## Fossarchy and Mossarchy
What I define as "FOSS-Anarchy" (abbreviated as "Fossarchy")
is as following:

"Fossarchy" is the fundemental idea that everybody -- without
question -- can contribute to a FOSS (Free and Open Source Software)
project. Think of it as a governance-type in FOSS. The fundemental
problems start to arise when people ruin projects and break them.

"Mossarchy" is the fundamental idea that everybody -- with
*minimal* question -- can contribute to a FOSS-project. It is the
FOSS definition of "Minarchy": The idea that there should be a
very, *very* minimal government. While this *might* work with
smaller projects: It does *not* work with larger ones. The
reason for this is that sabotage can occur and that...
Certain people might not be... Desirable. Regulation
-- and much of it -- is often necessary to not see
sabotage occur and having "undesirable" people
contributing.

## FOSS-tribalism
You know the USA? I don't live there, but I certainly know
it. There's a certain politician there who has followers
so tribal, so forgiving to their holy leader: That they'll
forgive him for commiting multiple felonies. His name is
Donald J. Trump and he is now -- somehow -- the president
of the USA. What I'm trying to convey is that the FOSS
community is almost as tribal as the USA Republican party
(though it be for a more noble cause), and that leads to...
Situations. Certainly.

### Richard Stallman
Richard M. Stallman is a FOSS-legend, known for his incredible
initiative "GNU" (GNU's Not Unix) and the FSF (Free Software
Foundation), he's truly a legend in the FOSS community! But
he shouldn't be. He shouldn't be the icon for the FOSS community.
It's a really strange controversy he found himself in... Yet
it happened. To save myself some time, I shall quote the
[wikipedia article on Richard Stallman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman):

*In September 2019, it was learned that Jeffrey Epstein had made donations to MIT, and in the wake of this,
MIT Media Lab director Joi Ito resigned. An internal MIT CSAIL listserv mailing list thread was started to
protest the coverup of MIT's connections to Epstein. In the thread, discussion had turned to deceased
MIT professor Marvin Minsky, who was named by Virginia Giuffre as one of the people that Epstein had forced
her to have sex with. Giuffre, a minor at the time, had been caught in Epstein's underage sex
trafficking ring. In response to a comment saying that Minsky "is accused of assaulting one of Epstein's
victims", Stallman objected to the inaccurate wording. Minsky was not accused of "assault", and from the
victims' testimonies it was not clear whether Minsky had committed "assault", and Stallman argued that "the
most plausible scenario is that she presented herself to him as entirely willing. Assuming she was being
coerced by Epstein, he would have had every reason to conceal that from most of his associates". When
challenged by other members of the mailing list, he added "It is morally absurd to define 'rape' in a way
that depends on minor details such as which country it was in or whether the victim was 18 years old or 17",
holding that it was not relevant to the harm that was done to the victim.*

Doesn't that seem like... Pedophilia? Or at least pedophilia sympathizing? Whether he's
pedophile or a pedophile sympathizer: (shocker) It's morally wrong to sympathize with
Jeffrey Epstein!!!

It's very strange that people seem to forgive Richard M. Stallman: Pedophile sympathizer
but not Linus Torvalds: Not pedophile sympathizer for banning Russian contributors of
the Linux project. Doesn't that seem morally corrupt?

### Linus Torvalds
Linus B. Torvalds is a Finnish programmer and father of the Linux kernel and the
Git version control system. He seems like a good person. Well, that's because he
is! But... Somewhere in his career something strange happened. A war in Ukraine.
He decided (rightfully) that it was morally wrong to support Russia when they
are attacking Ukraine. He (somewhat impulsively, I shall admit) excluded Russian
maintainers of the Linux Kernel because: "I'm Finnish. Did you think I'd be
supporting Russian aggression?". I completely agree with this, though the
way he acted was a bit impulsive.

For the last controversy I'll be covering, I'll be covering the *Godot
controversy*. This is truly the strangest one and it makes me very mad
just thinking about it. This is *also* where FOSS and the USA
republican party intersect (yes, it's going to be some conservative
bullshit).

### Godot Foundation
Godot is a game engine popular among the masses. It's FOSS, which makes
it an attractive choice for people like myself. Everything was going
well -- EVERYTHING -- but then...

*"Apparently game engines are woke now? Well then, we won't complain!
Show us your #wokot games below!"*

Harmless PR-message from the Godot PR team, right? According to FROSS
(*def:* Free, Republican and Open Source Software): It's *not*! But how?
Oh, wait! They are conservatives! Oh, I forgot: They don't have a
single good opinion on anything. The average debate with a Republican
goes like this:

(*R* = Republican, *P* = progressive)

*R*: Trans people shouldn't exist! Capitalism is king!  
*P*: What?  
*R*: I have all the best opinions!  
*P*: No? Also, what arguments do you have against trans people?  
*R*: I identify as a penguin!  
*P*: Now you're just making fun of people.  
*R*: Waaa! You're invalidating me!  
*P*: What? Also, penguin isn't a gender.  
*R*: There are only two genders, facts don't care about your feelings!  
*P*: Gender is a spectrum.  
*R*: No you \*\*\*\*\*!!!! YOU FUCKING \*\*\*\*\*\*\* \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*!  

In reality, the only people hating Godot after this is homophobic
and transphobic media, no one else. A very good example of demented
people criticizing Godot is this *schizophrenic*
["justice manifesto"](https://waiting-for-blue-robot.gitlab.io/justice_manifesto.html) by "XRayez".

### Impacts
Tribalism -- whether in politics or in FOSS -- is *bad*. It leads
to people making bad decisions because "You got to stick to the
tribe". Tribalism often has an *"Us Versus Them"* mentality
which can lead to innocent people getting hurt, and guilty people
getting away. Whatever you do, do *not* fall into the tribalism
mentality: It can lead to people getting hurt.
