# Meritocracy
*"The US is a meritocracy"*, one of the most blatant lies
ever told. There's no benefit to working hard, only the people
born into wealth (maybe by your father owning an emerald mine
in Africa, but I don't know) say this, either by blissful
ignorance or out of pure malice. But one thing often overlooked
is if meritocracy is actually a *good* governing system...

## The dangers of meritocracy
Short answer: It's terrible, you can go to the next chapter
now.

Long answer: A persons prosperity under a meritocracy is
based of two traits: "Hard work" and "Intelligence". I
will explain further later, but maybe you can determine
if this is a good system or not based of this:

1. Hard work:    Fail
2. Intelligence: Fail
3. Neither:      Fail
4. Both:         Succeed

Have you thought about your answer? Well, it's... VERY BAD!

### In-equal
We need to stop treating people differently based on how much
they've contributed to a project (contributions = merit in this
case). This is just straight up inequality and discourages
newcomers as they're treated much worse than the "devotees"
of the pack. It's almost like... A class system! This goes
against the principles of Technomarxism, as not everyone
is treated equally. FOSS-meritocracy leads to an eerily
similar class-system as to our real-world, where the
bourgeoise (devotees) are seen as "better" than the
proletariat (newcomers).

### Undemocratic
Meritocracy is largely undemocratic. What I mean by this is that
the newcomers almost have *no* say in anything, while the devotees
(or aristocrats in this situation) have *all* the say in the matter,
leading to a largely undemocratic system with large "class divide.",
which also leads to a hierarchy (and hierarchies are... Bad!?).

### Disorganized
It's unclear who makes the rules in a meritocracy. Is it the lead
developer, is it the people that have been contributing broken
code (yet a lot of it) or is it the people that contribute less,
yet better quality code? Even though I wish the 3rd group would
be the one that controls the project (even though that is not optimal,
as we should all lead the project together), it's not! Yet it's always
unclear if the 1st or 2nd person/group controls the project. It's
incredible disorganized and I'm honestly shocked that it is such
a popular way of governing. Even *Godot* (which we've already
defined as an oligarchy, though) claims to be a meritocracy:

*"But this is not all, Godot development is a true meritocracy. Code is only merged when deemed worthy by the
other developers. Every change is discussed for pros and cons.
This process is led by our large user community, who usually sets our priorities via issues (or just random rants
on our community sites :P). This same community helps with the testing and works directly with developers
implementing each feature to ensure it works as best as possible. Our process is truly community-driven from
beginning to end."*

## How meritocracies are formed
Meritocracies are often formed by well-meaning people that genuinely
believe that meritocracy is a good governing system, while it's not.
I discourage you to harass anybody who owns or maintains a
meritocratic project as they're often well-meaning people who are
simply misinformed (or maybe neoliberals but we shouldn't harass
them anyway \[*maybe*]).

## Republicans and meritocracies
We've already covered how there's already a pretty big part of the
FOSS community that are schizophrenic and don't have a single good opinion.
These people are called "Republicans" and are truly the worst of the worst
of FOSS. Yet, these people -- both in real-life and in FOSS -- Believe that
a meritocracy is only correct and is the correct way of running a FOSS-project.
These people are very, very wrong and have as small of a brain as the chance
of meritocracy succeeding. The people that say "The US is a meritocracy"
though, I believe: Are nationalists in disguise so there's no need to consider
them.

## Ending the meritocracy
*"Well then, if meritocracies are so bad, then lets get rid of them!"*, to that
I answer: *"Yes"*. It's a pretty good idea to end a meritocracy... But how?
Depends on the group you're trying to convert from meritocracy. Sometimes it's
as easy as just telling them *"No meritocracy!"* but it's often more intricate than
that. Don't go as far as to harass people, but opening issues or making public
announcements and calls to end the meritocracy often leads to democracy. This
tends to be a bit harder than ending a democracy, though. It can still fall
victim to the FOSS-corruption cycle with the exception of establishing a
democracy, but that just leads to a worse system: *Oligarchy*. It's next
to impossible to recover from oligarchy as any forks or new projects
will just go back into the FOSS-corruption cycle again and again and
again! But as we discussed in ["Democracy"](/books/technomarxist-manifesto/democracy),
there is a way to escape from the hellhole of the FOSS-corruption cycle,
that being: *Stop accepting donations!* Yet it tends to be a bit harder
with these meritocrats. But if you're able to reform the meritocracy
turned oligarchy by destroying the oligarchy: Please push for democracy,
for gods sake! We can collectively reform if we just accept change instead
of staying with the old and usual. The key to change is -- of course --
to accept it.
