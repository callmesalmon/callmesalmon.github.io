Books/Essays/eBooks I've written. They are... Somewhat readable
and I guess that you -- if you have eyes -- can experience them.
They are linked below.

## [Waiting for Marxocracy](wfm.pdf)
A view into the political landscape of FOSS and IT as a whole.
In this book, I explore concepts such as democracy, oligarchy
and corporate interest with a FOSS spin to it. I also try to
design an ultimate governing system for FOSS and IT as a
whole. This book also serves as a manifesto of sorts.

## [The Cyfraith Cath](cyfraith-cath/introduction)
A view into the kingdom of Wales in the medieval times,
especially the laws about our feline friends: cats (and, of
course, the sale of such). This book serves as both a satirical
piece and a historical piece about cats and the kingdom of Wales.
